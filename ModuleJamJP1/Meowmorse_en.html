                <h2>On the Subject of Meowmorse</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">&#x1F408 Is there a CAT indicator on the bomb?</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>This module looks like a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Metamorse.html">Metamorse</a>, but the hexagonal button has triangle ears. Pressing the top right button plays a song with a cat's meow. This decodes to a Morse code message of 3 to 6 letters. There are long pauses between letters. Decode the Morse code according to the following rules:</li><br>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul>
                        <li>If there are less than 2 indicators, turn each letter in the serial number into its numeric position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2,..., Z=26) and calculate the sum of the numbers. Subtract the number of "M", "E", "0(zero)", and "W" in the serial number from the total, and then modulo it by 3. Go to 4th instruction.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, get the first three indicators in alphabetical order. For each indicator, take the first letter if it is lit and the third letter if it is unlit to make a 3-letter word. If the word is "CAT", set the target-meow to the middle tone and skip to the next section.
                            <li>Turn each letter in the word into its numeric position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2,..., Z=26) and calculate the sum of the numbers. Subtract the number of vowels in the serial number from the number, and then modulo it by 3.</li>
                            <li>If it is 0, the target-meow is low tone. If it is 1, the target-meow is middle tone. Otherwise, the target-meow is high tone.</li>
                            <li>Press the display to get the sound of meow with the middle tone.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li>For each received meow from the song, use the table below to turn them into a sequence of dots and dashes. Use the column that applies to the pitch of the received meow compared to the target-meow and the row that matches the length of the received meow.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The morse code represents a word that represents a name of a cat. Find the name in Table C4T5 and get the meow pitch of that cat and the phrase to answer. </li>
                    <li>Press the arrow to set the pitch for transmission (the higher the cat in the display looks up, the higher the pitch gets).</li>
                    <li>Use the column that applies to the pitch for transmission compared to the target-meow, and turn them into short and long presses using Table M30W5. Press the hexagonal button to input the phrase. A press for more than 1 second is considered as a long press. Anything shorter than 1 second is considered as a short press.</li>
                    <li>Press the ear buttons to input the spaces between letters. If the last number of the serial number is even, use right; otherwise, use left.</li>
                    <li>Press the top-right button to submit the phrase.</li>
                    <li>If a wrong word is submitted or a wrong ear button is selected, it causes a strike and a new song will be selected.</li>
                    <li>Whether the sound is higher or not is compared with the target-meow.</li>
